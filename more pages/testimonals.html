                            <p>Hi guys, We are just killing it with WonderLister. The software is moving mountains for
                                us. I
                                think our revenue is up 200% in the last 60 days and there is no end in sight. There are
                                at
                                least 100 ways in which WL is better than any tool on the planet, and we are just
                                getting
                                started. My partner had their first successful Amazon Upload this week with new products
                                created on Amazon with zero errors. The custom fields and Field Mapping made it possible
                                to
                                dump 200+ columns right into their Upload Tool without any edits or changes. I cannot
                                describe the JOY I feel right now. Thanks again for EVERYTHING ðŸ˜Š</p>

                            <p>I am a power seller on eBay and had tried every listing tool our there. Nothing could
                                deal
                                with the volume of sales that I have to manage. Then came to WonderLister. Itâ€™s the only
                                desktop listing program that could handle my listings and all my content.</p>

                            <p>Wowâ€¦.this is really a powerful program youâ€™ve written here. Iâ€™m so excited to start using this. Iâ€™m amazed youâ€™ve made it possible to change the price of an active listing in the grid and it updates the listing automaticlly. Youâ€™ve got a lot of other features I wouldnâ€™t have thought about having that will save me time. Thank you for the help you gave me getting setup. Iâ€™ve tried just about every program out there and have not been happy for so many reasons. After years of searching it seems like I might have found what I was looking for. Canâ€™t tell you how happy I am. Thanks,</p>

                            <p>You all have done a great job in organizing data entry, and creating a UI that doesnâ€™t require an engineering degree. So far, most everything seems easy enough to figure out. Itâ€™s sleek, and elegant, and it does what itâ€™s supposed to with a minimum of fuss. It looks to be easier to find the template / tags editor now, too.</p>

                            <p>I was able to learn a large amount in a short amount of time. The prIT WORKED!!!!!! I
                                can't believe it, I am pinching myself right now ðŸ˜Š Please see an example. I moved from Nebulizers
                                155667 back over to the correct Category I needed 67589 and everything was perfect both
                                in WonderLister and on Ebay. It preserved all Hits, Watchers, & Sales exactly as I hoped
                                for: eBay Link I trained a brand new person tonight! I spent several hours with someone and
                                set them up to do all the Flat File exporting for Amazon. IN just 3 hours, having never seen
                                WL before, I had them with SQL 2012 running, everything set up and they completely
                                understood how to do everything without ever seeing the Help documentation! Guys, this software is
                                so incredible, you cannot imagine. The way it is now laid out with the Tabs, everything is
                                so simple and very easy to understand. Anyone with basic Excel or database training can
                                begin using WonderLister right away. Do you realize, We have reduced the learning curve from
                                Weeks to Hours vs. using other tools ðŸ˜Š Thanks again for being so very diligent!! It will
                                change lives in the Ecommerce Industry.
                                actical nature helped me understand what we were trying to do, and how to achieve it.

                             <p>I have been selling on eBay for a 1 1/2 years. I was previously using Auctiva. My main frustration with Auctiva was that it took too long to upload my photos to their server. Managing my photos was also frustrating. I was told by a friend about WonderLister and decided to try it out. It has been a couple of months now, and I am glad to say it has lived up to my expectations.</p>

                             <p>The WonderLister tool is really fast, because it is architected really well. And as opposed to some other tools, [Militello] says it is really simple to set up a listing. The other good thing is, you only pay for what you use.</p>
